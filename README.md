# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repo contains notebooks and related code for Udacity's Deep Learning with PyTorch lesson. This lesson appears in our [AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089).

* **1.** fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch for MNIST-dataset
* **2_1.** fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch for Fashion-MNIST
* **2_2.** Save model, load model and accuracy calculation with Fashion-MNIST
* **3.** Introduction to Transfer Learning with DenseNet
* **4.** CNN with Cifar10(Split the training data into a training and validation set, convolutional and pooling layers in CNN, save model if validation loss has decreased, and some visualization methods )
